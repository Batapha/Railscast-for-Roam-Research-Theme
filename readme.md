# Railscast dark theme for Roam Research
This is my personal version of the classic Railscast code syntax theme that I've tweaked over the years. This version has been created to work with [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com). 

It uses the beautiful serif font [Calendas Plus](http://atipofoundry.com/fonts/calendas-plus) by Atipo Type Foundry. I have no affiliation, but support them and buy the font. You'll thank yourself later.

## How to install
Install either [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html) or [Roam Toolkit](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/roam-toolkit/ebckolanhdjilblnkcgcgifaikppnhba). Then copy and paste the .css file contents into the appropriate location.
